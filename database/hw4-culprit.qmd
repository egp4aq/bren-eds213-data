```{sql}
-- Bird_eggs table has the number of eggs, year, and site 
-- Bird_nests table can join with the Bird_eggs via Nest_ID. From this join we can get observer code from Bird_nests 
-- Personnel table has Abbreviation column which can be joined to Observer column from Bird_nests and from there we can extract the actual name of the observer
-- to get the correct person, we need someone who was in nome between 1998 and 2008 and whose method for determining age was float
```

```{sql}
SELECT Personnel.Name, COUNT(Bird_nests.Nest_ID) AS Num_floated_nests
  FROM Bird_nests JOIN Personnel ON Bird_nests.Observer = Personnel.Abbreviation
  WHERE Bird_nests.Site = 'nome'
    AND Bird_nests.Year BETWEEN 1998 AND 2008
    AND Bird_nests.ageMethod = 'float'
    AND Bird_nests.Observer IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY Personnel.Name
  HAVING COUNT(Bird_nests.Nest_ID) = 36;
