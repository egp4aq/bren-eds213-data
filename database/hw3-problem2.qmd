### Part 1

```{sql}
SELECT Site_name, AVG(Area) FROM Site;
SELECT Site_name, COUNT(*) FROM Site;
SELECT Site_name, SUM(Area) FROM Site;

-- The error that we get from these queries: Binder Error: column "Site_name" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or must be part of an aggregate function. Either add it to the GROUP BY list, or use "ANY_VALUE(Site_name)" if the exact value of "Site_name" is not important.

SELECT ANY_VALUE(Site_name), SUM(Area) FROM Site;
```

We know that the exact name of site is not important becuase we are looking for an aggregate function on all sites. For example, in the `SELECT Site_name, SUM(Area) FROM Site;` query, we are trying to see the sum of area in all Site_names in the Site table, which means the Site_name itself is irrelevant. When we run `SELECT ANY_VALUE(Site_name), SUM(Area) FROM Site;`, which is what the error suggested, we get the correct output for the math part, but we get Barrow as the Site_name. It seems like SQL just chose the first site name in the list that it aggregated over. 

### Part 2

```{sql}
SELECT Site_name, Area FROM Site
    ORDER BY Area DESC
    LIMIT 1;
```

### Part 3

```{sql}
SELECT Site_name, Area FROM Site
    WHERE Area = (SELECT MAX(Area) FROM Site);
```
