### Part 1

```{sql}
-- Create temp table with column of type REAL
CREATE TEMP TABLE mytable (
    col REAL
);

-- Insert values into table with one NULL value
INSERT INTO mytable (col)
    VALUES
        (3), (5), (NULL), (2),(1);

-- Take the average of that column
SELECT AVG(col) FROM mytable;
```

The average value was calculated by completely ignoring the NULL value. The average is calculated as if there were only 4 values, i.e. (3+5+2+1)/4. However, if it did account for the null value, it would calculate the average like (3+5+0+2+1)/5, which would give us a lower value of 2.2 as opposed to the 2.75 that we got. 

### Part 2

```{sql}
SELECT SUM(col)/COUNT(*) FROM mytable;
SELECT SUM(col)/COUNT(col) FROM mytable;
```

The second query (SELECT SUM(col)/COUNT(col) FROM mytable;) gives us the correct average, while the first query (SELECT SUM(col)/COUNT(*) FROM mytable;) gives us the lower, incorrect average. This makes sense, seeing as the first COUNT(*) chooses all of the entries from table, but COUNT(col) does not account for the NULL value. 

```{sql}
-- Drop table
DROP TABLE mytable;
```
